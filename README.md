# Early_MS_Detection: Project Motivation
This project aims to investigate data gathered from retinal images through the development of machine learning (ML) and DL models, in an effort to differentiate healthy individuals and those with early signs of MS. By detecting cases early, patients can receive
treatment early to prevent the aggravation of their condition.

**Technical Details**

The code provided here is a segment of the project, and only focuses on image segmentation. This Python script aims to preprocess SLO images obtained from the FIVES dataset (available at https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-022-01564-3), and to train a U-Net to identify the location of blood vessels, which serve as anatomical landmarks.



**How To Run**

Simply download the .ipynb file and run it on Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook!
