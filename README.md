# Early_MS_Detection
Part of a larger project tackling the early detection of Multiple Schlerosis. This Python script aims to preprocess SLO images obtained from the FIVES dataset (available at https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-022-01564-3), and to train a U-Net to identify the location of blood vessels, which serve as anatomical landmarks.
